1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Problem background
SDG-7, "Affordable and Clean Energy," is imperative as an estimate of over 800
million people lack access to reliable electricity, (Wikipedia,
2023https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_7). "Affordable and
Clean Energy," the seventh Sustainable Development Goal (SDG-7) tackles a serious
7
worldwide energy dilemma. Over 800 million people are thought to live in a world
without access to consistent electricity, which exacerbates poverty and reduces
prospects for economic development and education. The majority of these areas
without power are those that are either economically poor or rural.
In addition, the current level of energy output around the world has a major role in the
destruction of the environment. Burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas is the
primary source of energy generation, accounting for around 60%(LITTLETON,
Colorado, Nov 30 (Reuters) 2023
https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/fossil-fuels-still-dominate-global-power-s
ystems-2023-11-30/ ), of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Despite being the most
widely used, these techniques seriously endanger the environment by causing habitat
destruction, air pollution, and climate change.
Furthermore, Global warming and environmental degradation have emerged as two
of the most challenging and definitive issues confronting all countries, it is observed that
non-renewable energy utilization and CO2 emission are associated inevitably(Journal of
Cleaner Production. (2022)
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652621042323 ).
Making the switch to renewable energy sources—like hydroelectric, solar, and wind
power—is essential to achieving SDG-7 targets and environmental sustainability.
Creating the infrastructure and technologies necessary to enable the production and
delivery of inexpensive, clean energy is part of this shift. By accomplishing this, the
8
world's dependency on dangerous fuels might be greatly reduced, opening the way to a
cleaner and sustainable energy future.
1.2 Organization or system environment background
The EnergyVanguard project is in the background of environmental pollution and lack
of renewable energy, the purpose of the project is to solve environmental problems by
the use of fossil fuels. With technological advancements and decreasing costs, the
global demand for renewable resources is increasing. We are committed to funding this
project, promoting the use of renewable resources, reducing carbon emissions, and
creating a sustainable future.
The EnergyVanguard initiative is in line with the goals outlined in significant
international agreements, like the Paris Agreement, which aims to fortify the global
response to the threat of climate change (United Nations, 2015
https://www.un.org/climatechange/paris-agreement ), as part of the global reaction to
climate change. In addition, the project will help fulfill Sustainable Development Goal 7
of the UN, which aims to provide everyone with modern, affordable, dependable, and
sustainable energy (United Nations, 2023
https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/energy/).
EnergyVanguard seeks to act as a catalyst for change in the energy industry by
incorporating state-of-the-art renewable technologies and encouraging creative energy
9
solutions. Our strategy is to back projects that show measurable gains in energy
efficiency and carbon footprint reduction.
1.3 System overview
The EcoPower connect system is a platform for users to discover and buy renewable
resources. Our system, EcoPower connect,will offer a user-friendly web-based interface
and mobile app with a good user experience. The system will inform users about nearby
clean energy sources companies，which have a broader range of clean energy
products and services, such as energy-efficient appliances and green building
materials. After the purchase is made, It can track the customers purchase details, and
energy efficiency.
1.3.1 System objectives
Objective 1: Reduce Carbon Emissions Through Clean Energy:
10
By shifting the focus to clean energy, the system directly contributes to a reduction in
the carbon footprint of energy consumption. This has the potential to slow climate
change, improve air quality, and reduce health risks associated with pollution. It also
supports the transition to a sustainable energy economy.
Objective 2: Provide Affordable Energy Services
Making energy services more affordable can significantly impact the economic
well-being of individuals and communities. Lower energy costs mean that households
can allocate more of their budget to other essential needs, contributing to overall
poverty reduction. Affordability also increases the accessibility of clean energy,
encouraging more widespread adoption.
Objective 3: Increase Awareness of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency
Increased awareness leads to informed decision-making among consumers, which can
drive the demand for renewable energy sources and products. Educating the public
about the benefits of energy efficiency can result in behavior change that contributes to
energy conservation and sustainability goals.
11
Objective 4: Foster Community Engagement
Engaged communities are more likely to come together to support clean energy
initiatives, leading to stronger advocacy for environmental policies and shared
responsibility in implementing sustainable practices. Community engagement can also
stimulate local economies by promoting local clean energy businesses and creating
jobs.
